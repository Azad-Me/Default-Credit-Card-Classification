# Default-Credit-Card-Classification

## Project Summary -
A bank wanted to minimize their financial losses due to credit card defaults and decided to embark on a project to develop a machine learning model that could predict which customers were most likely to default on their payments.

The bank's team gathered a large amount of data on their customers, including credit ratings, transaction history, and demographic information.
They used this data to train a predictive model that would analyze a new customer's data and determine their likelihood of defaulting in the future.

The project involved several stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development. However, the team was able to develop a reliable predictive model that helped the bank reduce its financial losses significantly.

The machine learning model helped the bank identify high-risk customers early on and take proactive measures to prevent defaults. They could also provide better service to customers by tailoring credit offerings to their individual needs.

Overall, the Credit Card Default Prediction project was a success story for the bank. By using machine learning to solve a real-world problem, they were able to minimize financial losses and improve customer satisfaction. The bank was now better positioned to make informed credit decisions and offer better service to their customers.
